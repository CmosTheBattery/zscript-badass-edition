# faq


#### what in the ass is this

an overly ambitious stupid joke wad for freedoom

#### update when?

when anyone in the team feels like doing so, or you can update it yourself if you have the proper skills and making a pull request

#### i would like to contribute to the project pretty please

go right ahead, fork the project, make some changes and make a pull request!

you can also join our [discord](https://discord.gg/Rb6DyWyNXV) if you want to get in contact with most of the team

if you want to contribute to the mappack, check the CREDITS file included for any open map slots

#### what should I do if I spot an unusual and possibly game breaking bug, or just want you guys to add something?

you can just send an issue to our github page

#### how do I play multiplayer?

[check the zdoom wiki article about multiplayer](https://zdoom.org/wiki/Multiplayer) for the basic stuff

the multiplayer is sadly only possible on lan, unless you're willing to go through doxxing yourself and port forwarding, but even then zdoom's sloppy netcode will give you a headache when playing with more than 2 players or with your homeboy in somalia or serbia

if you need any help or want to find someone willing to play you can check out our [discord](https://discord.gg/Rb6DyWyNXV)

#### is zandronum going to be supported?

no, unless they catch up to the 2549 updates. in the meantime you still can play bad*ss deathmatch on your local network using gzdoom or lzdoom (check the question right above this)

#### can I play on other iwads?

the generally recommended experience is playing the mod through freedoom phase 2

phase 1 and the official id software doom iwads are not supported and will not be a pleasant experience due to missing textures or sounds

other iwads like strife, hexen, heretic and more are **DEFINITELY** not supported, and you will definitely have a very busted and janky experience

#### i have no money for freedoom

what

#### this is too bad*ss for me

too bad

# sourceport compatibility

* gzdoom v4.13: perfect
* gzdoom v4.14: perfect
* lzdoom v3.88: alright (missing localization and text)
* qzdoom: untested but might work
* your toaster in the kitchen: only works on friday the 13th during a solar eclipse
* zandronum: doesn't work (no zscript)
* zdoom: doesn't work (dinosaur)
* anything non-gzdoom/lzdoom based or vanilla ports: doesn't work (it's built on gzdoom dum dum)
