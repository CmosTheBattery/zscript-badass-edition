## freedoom bad*ss edition

the most bad*ss freedoom mod on earth

made for gzdoom and lzdoom

warning: this mod contains very b*d language!!!!

if you're a mapper and want to contribute, see the credits file for open map slots

the mod mostly works on doom 2 but it won't be a nice experience (after all it's freedoom bad*ss edition)

zandronum compatibility isn't planned until they catch up to the 1000 updates
