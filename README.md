# faq

#### is zandronum going to be supported?

no, but you still can play bad*ss deathmatch on your local network using gzdoom or lzdoom (check the question right below this)

#### how do I play multiplayer?

https://zdoom.org/wiki/Multiplayer for the basic stuff

if you need any help or want to find someone willing to play you can check out our [discord](https://discord.gg/wsBdTfru9z)

#### update when?

when anyone in the team feels like doing so, or you can update it yourself if you have the proper skills and making a pull request

#### what should I do if I spot an unusual and possibly game breaking bug, or just want you guys to add something?

you can just send an issue to our github page

#### can I play on other iwads?

the generally recommended experience is playing the mod through freedoom phase 2

phase 1 and the doom iwads work mostly fine, but you won't get the fullest and nicest experience (after all, it's **freedoom** bad*ss edition)

other iwads like strife, hexen, heretic and more are not guaranteed to work and you will definitely not have a good experience

#### i would like to contribute to the project pretty please

go right ahead, you can also join our [discord](https://discord.gg/wsBdTfru9z) if you want to get in contact with the rest of the team

if you want to contribute to the mappack, check the CREDITS file included for any open map slots

#### i have no money for freedoom

what

#### this is too bad*ss for me

too bad
